2. Additional Terms — Commercial Royalty
2.1. Commercial Use of this Software is subject to a royalty obligation to the Licensor (the copyright holder), unless explicitly exempted below.
2.2. “Commercial Use” means any use, distribution, SaaS offering, internal deployment tied to revenue generation or cost reduction, embedding in a paid product or service, or use by for-profit entities for business operations.
2.3. “Licensor” means the copyright holder named above.

3. Royalty Schedule (Guidance)
The payable royalty ranges from 5% up to 25% of net revenue attributable to the Software, determined as follows:
- 5%: Minimal or ancillary use (non-core functionality, prototypes, or internal tools with limited scope).
- 10%: Moderate use (Software forms a notable but non-primary component of a commercial product or service).
- 15%: Significant use (Software materially contributes to value delivery or operational savings).
- 20%: Core use (Software is a primary component enabling the product/service).
- 25%: White-label or redistribution scenarios where the Software is central and repackaged for resale.
Notes:
- “Net revenue attributable” should reasonably apportion revenue or savings connected to the Software’s role.
- When in doubt, contact the Licensor to agree on a fair rate and basis. Written waivers or adjustments override this schedule.
